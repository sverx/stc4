STC4 simple tile compressor

uses 4 bytes RAM buffer

one byte holds information on how to create a group of 4 bytes, providing two bits for each:

    D7 D6          D5 D4            D3 D2          D1 D0
 
   1st byte       2nd byte         3rd byte       4th byte

%10 -> byte has value $00
%11 -> byte has value $FF
%01 -> byte is a different value, uncompressed byte follows
%00 -> repeat last uncompressed value from same group of 4 bytes


note: if D7,D6 are both zero it means this new whole group of 4 bytes is based on the previous group so:

      - if D5 = 0 then we need to repeat the whole previous group again, up to 31 times (counter is value in D4-D0) 

        %000nnnnn  (if nnnnn is 0 it means EOD)

      - if D5 = 1 then we need to use the last group of 4 bytes replacing each value that has a 1 in D3-D0 with a raw value that follows (up to 3)

        %001cxxxx  (xxxx contains from 0 up to 3 'ones')

        [ if D4 is 1 then it means bytes from the previous group of 4 bytes needs to be complemented, so for instance a value of $02 becomes $FD and viceversa ]
